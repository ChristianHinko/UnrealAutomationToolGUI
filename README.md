# UnrealAutomationToolGUI
A GUI exposed AutomationTool with parameters to simplify the packaging process in Unreal.
I made this because I hate dealing with command line interfaces and making builds is a pain with the really long UAT arguments.
This is also a really good practice for someone who is planning on heavily automating their projects using the UAT command line as the parameter names in the GUI are the same as the actual command line arguments.
